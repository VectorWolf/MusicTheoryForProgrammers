# What is a note?
To be super general, a note itself is nothing but a soundwave with a distinct frequency. 1337Hz for example, thats a note. But what usually is meant when most musical persons talk about notes is a note in the western 12-tone-equal-temperament-system. Virtually all pop music, from classic till today is written in it (or slightest variations of it). This system builds on the repetition of 12 reocurring notes.

How this works? It's relatively easy, you start at a frequency, lets say 440Hz, thats our zero'th note and by doubling it to 880Hz you get the 12th note. The notes inbetween are a bit more difficult to calculate, since we can't just interpolate linearly but have to "follow the curvature" of the xÂ² function. This means to get the next note, you have to multiply with the 12th root of two which is roughly 1.05946... . Here's an example starting from 440Hz with rounding applied.

|Step     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Factor   | 1.0 |1.059|1.122|1.189|1.260|1.335|1.414|1.498|1.584|1.682|1.782|1.888| 2.0 |
|Frequency| 440 |466.2|493.9|523.3|554.4|587.3|622.3|659.3|698.5|740.0|784.0|830.6| 880 |

How do we know at what frequency we should start? Well actually there is no right and wrong and you can choose this pitch as you pleasy. Most commonly used is 440Hz with steps above and below, but the selection is arbitrary. The chosen pitch is then called "concert pitch".

A small note, if you're "sub-stepping" betwenn the notes there is a unit called cents. A note +100 cents gets you the next note, a note +50 gets you a note right inbetween which is outside the system.

How does this sound? Well, the doubling of the frequency (commonly called octave) sounds like just the same note but higher (or lower if halved) und is the main building block of the notation system.

The notation system, which is used to most commonly write and talk about notes is, in my opinion, one big hysterical raisin and pretty bad to understand, like most natural languages honestly. It's C D E F G A B.

But wait, there are five notes missing? Yes, this is because all notes are expressed relative to the C-Major scale (we get to scales later), and the missing notes inbetween are called sharp(#) or flat(b) depending on if youre going up or down in pitch. Also you have to memorize that there are no steps between B and C and between E and F. 

What makes this even more awful is that you can accumulate as many # or b behind a note which makes reading more difficult (C## = D). I personally find this favouring of C-Major a bit silly and off-putting especially for beginner so I vow for the so called "Integer Scale" which is more commonly used by mathematicians and looks in this case just like an ordinary Base 12 Number going from 0 to 9 to B to 0 again (Which is super easy if you're used to hex).

|Step     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |
